# Light-DehazeNet
Light-DehazeNet: A Novel Lightweight CNN Architecture for Single Image Dehazing

![](readme_images/Picture1.png)

### Introduction
This repo contains the implementation of our proposed LD-Net, the prerequisite libraries, and link of the dataset we have used in our experiments. For testing purpose we also provide a trained LD-Net weights and test hazy images. 

### Installation
---
This code is written with Anaconda python 3.7. Install the Anaconda python 3.7 and clone the repo with the following command:
```
git clone https://github.com/hayatkhan8660-maker/Light-DehazeNet.git
cd Light-DehazeNet
```

----
### Dependencies
This code requires the following libraries, install these libraries before testing th code. 
- torch==1.9.1
- torchvision==0.10.1
- numpy==1.19.2
- PIL==8.2.0
- matplotlib==3.3.4

run ```pip install -r requirements.txt``` to install all the dependencies. 

# Training Dataset
For training we have used the Synthetic Hazy Dataset generated by [Boyi Li](https://sites.google.com/site/boyilics/website-builder/project-page) and his team for single image dehazing task. The dataset can be downloaded using the following links. 

- The synthetic hazy images [training set](https://drive.google.com/file/d/17ZWJOpH1AsYQhoqpWR6PK61HrUhArdAK/view)
